I am here trying to do a prototype of a useful application of AR.js. It is light weight and runs with just a file and its markers.
The 'markers' folder is just for my test purposes

Run the ARKeyBoard.js file and scan a Hiro marker to see the AR Keyboard just above the marker.
Select the letters using the AR pointer/cursor. Move the camera to adjust the position of the cursor.
The selected typed letters/words are shown in the text area.

Do Try!!
