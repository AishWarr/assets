Trying to do a prototype of a useful application of AR.js. It is light weight keyboard and runs with just a file and its AR markers.
The 'mARker','premarker' folders are just for my test purposes.

Run the ARKeyBoard.js file and scan a Hiro marker to see the AR Keyboard just above the marker.
Select the letters using the AR pointer/cursor. Move the camera to adjust the position of the cursor.
The selected typed letters/words are shown in the text area.

Do Try!!
